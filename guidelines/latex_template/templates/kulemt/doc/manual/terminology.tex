\chapter{Terminology}
\label{cha:terminology}
\begin{termlist}
\item[Back matter]
  The back matter conveys information ancillary to that in the main matter,
  such as a bibliography, an index, or a glossary.
\item[Copyright page]
  Second (unnumbered) page of the thesis, containing the copyright
  statements. It is part of the front pages.
\item[Cover page]
  The cover page (\Dutch{kaft} in Dutch) is the outside front page.
  Although it is part of the front pages, it is not part of the printed or
  electronic thesis. It is generated separately.
\item[Document class option \latex]
  A document class option can only be used as an option of the
  \cs{documentclass} command.
\item[Engine \latex]
  In TeX parlance, the engine is the program which compiles the TeX
  document using a macro package. Several engines currently exist: TeX (the
  original by D.\ Knuth, outputting \file{.dvi}), eTeX (TeX with some
  extended capabilities), pdfTeX (extended eTeX and additional \PDF\
  output), XeTeX (eTeX which can use system fonts), and \mbox{LuaTeX}
  (scriptable pdfTeX, still under development). All these engines can
  preload the LaTeX macro package. On modern systems, \file{latex} means
  pdfTeX in compatibility mode (equivalent to the TeX engine) with LaTeX
  preloaded and \file{pdflatex} means pdfTeX with LaTeX preloaded
  (generating \file{.pdf} output).
\item[Filing card]
  The filing card (\Dutch{fiche} in Dutch) is a one-page summary containing
  all administrative information about the thesis. When included in the
  text, it is part of the back matter.
\item[Font]
  A font is a set of visual representations of characters in a specific
  typeface.
\item[Font family]
  A font family is a set of fonts designed to work harmoniously together.
  Typically this means at least a roman font and an italic font. But it can
  be extended to combinations of serif and sans-serif fonts.
\item[Front matter]
  The front matter is the part of the thesis, which contains the
  introductory material such as a preface, an abstract, and content lists
  (table of contents, list of tables, list of figures, list of symbols, etc.).
\item[Front pages]
  In this text the front pages refer to the the cover page, the title page
  and the copyright page.
\item[Leading]
  Leading is the vertical space between two lines of text. The line spacing
  is the font size plus the leading.
\item[Main matter]
  The main matter is the middle part of the thesis, between the front and
  the back matter. It contains the actual information of the thesis in
  regular chapters and appendices.
\item[Master language]
  The master language refers to the official language of the master.
  Usually it is the same as the text language but not necessarily.
\item[Once-only option \latex]
  A once-only option can only be used once, either as an argument of a
  \cs{setup} command or as an option of the \cs{documentclass} command.
\item[Optical alignment of margins]
  Some characters (e.g., punctuation) can make a line appear shorter than
  others to the human eye. Shifting such characters by an appropriate
  amount into the margins (called character protrusion) gives the impression
  that the margins are aligned and not ragged.
\item[Point (pt)]
  A point (pt) is a printer's unit: $72.27\,\mathrm{pt} = 1\,\mathrm{inch} =
  25.4\,\mathrm{mm}$. PostScript and other popular software, such as word
  processors, use a slightly larger point size: $72\,\mathrm{pt} =
  1\,\mathrm{inch}$.
\item[Preamble \latex]
  The document preamble is the part of a LaTeX document, which comes before
  the \verb"\begin{document}" command.
\item[Protrusion]
  See `Optical alignment of margins'.
\item[Recto page]
  The recto page is the right-hand page of a printed book. It normally
  corresponds to odd numbered pages.
\item[Repeatable option \latex]
  A repeatable option can be used as an option of the \cs{documentclass}
  command or as an argument of a \cs{setup} command. It can be used
  multiple times without problem.
\item[Serif]
  A serif is a cross stroke at the bottom of a letter. Compare a serif and
  a sans-serif typeface: ``{\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont A serif}'' and
  ``{\fontfamily{lmss}\selectfont A sans-serif}''.
\item[Text language]
  The text language refers to the language used to write the text in.
  Usually it is the same as the master language but not necessarily.
\item[Title page]
  The first (unnumbered) page of the thesis. It is part of the front pages.
\item[Typeface]
  A typeface is a visual style to represent characters, regardless of their
  size. This sentence uses the typeface `\rmfontname'. 
\item[Verso page]
  The verso page is the left-hand page of a printed book. It normally
  corresponds to even numbered pages.
